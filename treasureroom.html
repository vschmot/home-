<p><mark>YOU WALK INTO THE ROOM. SUITS OF ARMOR ARE PLACED IN ROWS ON EITHER SIDE LEADING YOU TO A CASE OF BEAUTIFUL JEWELS. YOU PICK ONE OF THE JEWELS UP TO EXAMINE IT AND ARE SUPRISED AT HOW LIGHT AND DELICATE IT FEELS IN YOUR HAND. IT CASTS A DAZZLING PRISM OF COLORS AS THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH IT. YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
