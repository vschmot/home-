<p>AS YOU KNOCK THE DOOR SLIGHTLY OPENS. WITH A LIGHT PUSH YOU ARE ABLE TO FULLY OPEN THE DOOR. BEAUTIFUL CHANDELIERS HANG FROM THE CEILING IN THE ENTRYWAY. JUST A FEW FEET AWAY YOU SPOT A FIREPLACE THAT YOU COULD USE TO WARM UP. TO YOUR RIGHT THERE IS ALSO A ROOM WITH A LARGE DISPLAY OF JEWELRY AND GEMS.</p>
